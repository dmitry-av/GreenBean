# GreenBean

GreenBean is a social music service that allows users to share their musical preferences, showcase their music collections, and review musical releases. App has the potential to be a valuable resource for music lovers, allowing them to discover new music, connect with other fans, and share their passion for music. With the ability to review musical releases and showcase their collections, users can contribute to a vibrant and engaging community centered around their love of music.  

The app is currently in development, and I am using Django REST Framework (DRF) to build the backend and React with Redux for the frontend.
App works the Discogs API to fetch musical releases data.

To run development version with Docker-compose:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml  --env-file ./docker/backend/docker.env up --build
